Spring Boot: gRPC, GraphQL, and SOAP Testing
This repository showcases the integration and testing of three distinct communication protocols—gRPC, GraphQL, and SOAP—using Spring Boot. The project demonstrates how to build and expose APIs with each protocol, focusing on their implementation, testing, and practical usage in modern microservice architectures.

Features:
gRPC: High-performance, language-neutral RPC framework.
GraphQL: Flexible query language for efficient data retrieval.
SOAP: Traditional web service protocol for interoperable systems.
Spring Boot setup for seamless development.
Sample implementations and test cases for each protocol.
Use cases:
Compare performance and flexibility across gRPC, GraphQL, and SOAP.
Learn best practices for integrating each protocol in Spring Boot applications.
Explore microservice communication options.
